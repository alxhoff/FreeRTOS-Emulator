 * @date 27 August 2019
 * @brief A SDL2 based library to implement work queue based drawing of graphical
 * elements. Allows for drawing using SDL2 from multiple threads.
 *
 * @mainpage FreeRTOS Simulator Graphical Library
 *
 * @section intro_sec About this library
 *
 * This basic API aims to provide a simple method for drawing
 * graphical objects onto a screen in a thread-safe and consistent fashion.
 * The library is built on top of the widely used SDL2 graphics, text and sound
 * libraries. The core of the library is the functionality found in @ref tum_draw
 * with extra features such as event handling and sound found in the auxiliary
 * files.
